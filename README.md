#LennyDevX 

Welcome to my web portfolio, where you can explore and learn more about me and my work as a full-stack web developer. My name is Lenny DevX and I am passionate about creating innovative and functional solutions with the latest technologies. 

In this portfolio you will be able to see some of the projects I have carried out, both personal and professional, using different tools and frameworks. Some of them are: 

Umbrella App ☔️ A weather web app, ask the weather based on your location. This is a simple project and any user can collaborate and develop this project into a more complete and advanced web app. I will be updating it little by little. 

Cipher App ⛓️ It is a software that allows you to encrypt and decrypt text messages. If you want to share a text file with sensitive information but you would like to encrypt the message, you can do it with Cipher with 2 different algorithms. I invite you to try it and of course to collaborate on it and make a more powerful encryption program!
